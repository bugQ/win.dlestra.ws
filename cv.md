I'm a software engineer with over 5 years professional experience,
with specialties in **front-end development** (most notably with
[ASP.Net](https://asp.net/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), and
[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)) and **real-time systems and graphics programming**
(game engines, scientific visualisations, etc.).
Although a majority of my  programming experience lies with **C#** and **C++**,
I continue to hone my skills with other languages, including
**Ruby**, **Rust**, **Javascript**, **Haskell**, **Elm**, and **F#**.

I'm accustomed to acquiring team skills and fulfilling roles as the
job mandates, including:

- source management/integration
- server administration
- meeting facilitation
- peer software training
- dev tool innovation


# Experience

## 2018._08_--2020._+_ [University of Missouri Division of IT](https://doit.missouri.edu)

Maintaining over 70 applications used actively by students, faculty, and staff.

Heavy use of ASP.NET Core (or legacy MVC) for web applications, frontends using Bootstrap
and Vue.JS (or legacy jQuery).  Database schema design, administration, and automation.

Coordination with multiple stakeholders to gather requirements and involve them in
continuous integration and testing.


## 2005._12_--2018._07_ [Private Tutoring]()

Providing one-on-one help to students of mathematics and computer science, up to
and including calculus, linear algebra and statistics, as well as boolean logic,
computer architecture, scientific computing, and high-level software design.

Making special effort to ensure that students are self-motivated,
and to reveal the simplicity underlying these complex topics.


## 2017._04_--2017._09_ [Punk This Studios](http://punkthisstudios.com/)

Working under the direction of the company founder over a
remote contract, I rewrote a prototype 2.5D game engine from SDL/C++98
into SDL2/C++11 while cooperatively working out design flaws and designing
new features.  We exchanged expertise regarding C++11 standards and
practices, maintaining a high level of code quality through code reviews and
static analysis tools.

Being a complete rewrite, my work touched every aspect of the engine:

- resource loading and management,
- procedural map generation,
- optimized pathfinding,
- rendering 2D objects in multiple layers from a 3D point-perspective camera,
- and remappable controls from multiple input devices.

Additionally, I incorporated and documented build scripts for a
[cross-platform build system](http://mesonbuild.com/), enabling a Linux
build and bringing it into stricter C++ standards adherence.

## 2015._08_--2016._05_ [Kokua Games](https://www.kokuagames.com/)

[Maui](https://www.kokuagames.com/) was a 12-member professional game project
at the [EAE Master Game Studio](https://eae.utah.edu/graduate-programs/),
[released on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/464700) in April 2016.  

Following Hawaii native lead designer Sean Keanaaina's direction, I
contributed the implementation of Maui's central mechanic, an innovative HUD
system for modulating the player characters's attributes in
realtime.  Named for the concept of Prayer, the Pule system was designed
to reflect the geographic houses of [the four primary gods of the Hawaiian
pantheon](http://paulwaters.com/learning/in-the-begining-hawaiian-gods/), and
made use of custom shaders and graphic design principles.

Aside from the central Pule system, I implemented the rest of the HUD and
integrated it with the in-game glossary, called the Halau.  In addition, I:

- trained the team on the proper use of distributed version control,
- stepped in frequently to help resolve merge conflicts and other Git errors,
- shared my expertise in UX/UI design, game AI, physics, and linear algebra,
- assisted in design and research efforts to ensure an educational and
  culturally accurate experience (see:

## 2015._08_--2016._05_ [The Gapp Lab](https://thegapp.eae.utah.edu/)

*[The Gapp Lab]: Theraputic Games and Apps Lab

Partnering with research institutions and grant groups, I was the lead
engineer in two projects, using the tools (primarily Unity) and methodology
of game development to provide a creative perspective on real-world,
large-scale health problems.  Together, we prototyped software for use on the
field in Mumbai to help administer screening tests for contagious illnesses,
as well as an interactive informational app for educating potential patients
about the purpose, safety, and methodology of prenatal screening tests.

Some of the challenges faced in these two projects included:

- providing regular mockups and builds to partners and incorporating feedback,
- interfacing with [RedCAP](https://www.project-redcap.org/) databases in a
  HIPAA-compliant manner,
- importing and parsing data from portable blood screening devices,
- ensuring language-independent UI and pictographic design,
- representing statistical data in interactive, exporable ways,
- and procedurally animating many small actors using Game AI techniques.


## 2014._12_--2015._07_ [XacFAQ](http://www.guv1.com/xacfaq/)

Founded by industry veteran Jon Dean, XacFAQ used Unity to produce social
games and apps.  I was hired in 2014 on a contract with a third party to
develop a mobile app tie-in to a popular Facebook-centered franchise.

We practiced iterative UX design, working directly with the partner company
and lead designer to prototype, review, and finalize the user interface.  My
work involved:

- in-depth familiarity with the NGUI framework for Unity 4.0,
- manual optimization of art assets for the Unity pipeline,
- client-side JSON-based server interactions,
- and integration with plugins for Facebook accounts and in-app purchases.

## 2012._01_--2014._04_ [J. Willard Marriott Library](https://lib.utah.edu)

Working in the library's Apple IT Services group, which oversees hundreds of
Mac workstations and servers across the University of Utah campus, I was
assigned special software projects such as:

- automated computer kiosk proxy whitelist management,
- automated software and driver packaging for users of campus printers,
- and ZEROCONF/Bonjour-compatible campus-wide printer service discovery.

As a computer support technician, I also shared responsibly for software
package updates and maintenance, and responding to technical support tickets.

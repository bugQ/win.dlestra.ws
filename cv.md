# Summary of Skills

I'm a game engineer with 3+ years of experience in game development contract
work, 5+ years overall development experience, and training in a broad range
of areas. I'm accustomed to acquiring skills and fulfilling roles as the job
mandates, including overseeing <b>source code integration</b>, <b>web/server
administration</b>, <b>team management</b>, and <b>software training</b>.  I
also have volunteer and work experience with <b>individual tutoring</b> in a
variety of mathematics and science subjects.

In summary of my technical skills, I've done work in the following areas:

- 2D and 3D realtime rendering,
- 2D and 3D realtime physics,
- AI and pathfinding,
- networking and messaging,
- event and trigger systems,
- gameplay scripting,
- asset/metadata [de]serialization,
- memory management and optimization.

I'm familiar with <b>cross-platform development</b> for and on all major
operating systems, using anything from <b>SDL2</b> to raw
<b>OpenGL</b>/<b>GLSL</b> and <b>DirectX</b>/<b>HLSL</b> to
[<b>Unity</b>](https://unity3d.com/) and [<b>Phaser</b>](https://phaser.io/).
Although a majority of my experience lies with <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, and
<b>Javascript</b>, crafting abstractions in most programming languages comes
relatively naturally, with a preference toward the functional.


# Experience

## [Punk This Studios](http://punkthisstudios.com)
### 2017.04&ndash;2017.09

Working under the direction of the company founder, and over long-distance
remote communication, I rewrote a prototype 2.5D game engine from SDL/C++98
into SDL2/C++11 while cooperatively working out design flaws and designing
new features.  We exchanged expertise regarding C++11 standards and
practices, maintaining a high level of code quality through code reviews and
static analysis tools.

Being a complete rewrite, my work touched every aspect of the engine:
resource loading and management, core gameplay code (including design
discussions), rendering 2D objects from a 3D point-perspective camera, and
remappable controls from multiple input devices.

Additionally, I incorporated and documented build scripts for a
[cross-platform build system](http://mesonbuild.com/), enabling a Linux
build and bringing it into stricter C++ standards adherence.


## [Kokua Games](https://www.kokuagames.com/)
### 2015.08&ndash;2016.05

This was a 12-member professional game project at the
[EAE Master Game Studio](https://eae.utah.edu/graduate-programs/),
released on Steam in April 2016.  

Following lead designer Sean Keanaaina's design documentation, I contributed
the implementation of the game's central mechanic, an innovative HUD system
for modulating the player characters's attributes in realtime, using the UI
system introduced in 4.6, and a mix of basic trigonometry, custom shaders
and graphic design principles.

The system was 

Aside from the central Pule system, I implemented the rest of the HUD and
other features, including:

- on-screen health and inventory status indicators,
- world-to-canvas projection effects, such as for enemy health bars,
- smooth time dilation while Pule system is in use to prevent overstimulation,
- procedural on-screen indicators of Pule system changes by the player,
- map screen with automatically projected icons of the player and landmarks.
 
I trained almost the entire team on the proper use of version control, and
shared my expertise in UX/UI design, game AI, physics, and linear algebra.
During our design meetings, I collaborated with Sean and the producers in
design and research efforts to ensure an educational and culturally accurate
experience (see:

## [The GApp Lab (*The*raputic *G*ames and *App*s *Lab*)](https://thegapp.eae.utah.edu/)
### 2015.08&ndash;2016.05

Partnering with research institutions and grants, I was the lead engineer in
two projects, using the tools and methodology of game development to provide
a creative perspective on real-world, large-scale health problems.  With
Unity, we prototyped software for use on the field in Mumbai to help
administer screening tests for contagious illnesses, as well as an
interactive informational app for educating potential patients about the
purpose, safety, and methodology of prenatal screening tests.

Some of the technical challenges faced in these projects included:

- interfacing with RedCAP databases in a HIPAA-compliant manner,
- importing and parsing data from portable blood screening devices,
- language-independent UI and pictographic design,
- representing statistical data in interactive, exporable ways,
- procedural animation of many small actors, leveraging Game AI techniques.


## [XacFAQ](http://www.guv1.com/xacfaq/)
### 2014.12&ndash;2015.06

Founded by industry veteran Jon Dean, XacFAQ used Unity to produce social
games and apps.  I was hired in 2014 on a contract with a third party to
develop a mobile app tie-in to a popular Facebook-based franchise.

We practiced iterative UX design, working directly with the partner company
and lead designer to prototype, review, and finalize the user interface.  My
work involved:

- in-depth familiarity with the NGUI framework for Unity 4.0,
- implementation of custom UI widgets,
- manual optimization of art assets for the Unity pipeline,
- client-side server interactions,
- integration with plugins for Facebook accounts and in-app purchases.


## [J. Willard Marriott Library](https://lib.utah.edu)
### 2012.01&ndash;2014.04

Working in the library's Apple IT Services group, which oversees hundreds of
Mac workstations and servers across the University of Utah campus, I was
assigned special software projects such as:

- automated computer kiosk proxy whitelist management via browser automation,
- automated software and driver packaging for users of campus networks,
- and ZEROCONF/Bonjour-compatible campus-wide printer service discovery.

As a computer support technician, I also shared responsibly for software
package updates and maintenance and responding to technical support tickets.

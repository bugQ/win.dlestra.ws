# Skills

I'm a game engineer with 3+ years of experience in independent contract work, and training in a broad number of areas. I'm accustomed to acquiring skills and fulfilling roles as the job mandates, including overseeing <b>source code integration</b>, <b>web/server administration</b>, <b>team management</b>, and <b>software training</b>.  I also have volunteer and work experience with <b>individual tutoring</b> in a variety of mathematics and science subjects.

Concerning technical skills, I've done work in the following areas:

- 2D and 3D realtime rendering
- 2D and 3D realtime physics
- AI and pathfinding
- networking and messaging
- event and trigger systems
- gameplay scripting
- asset/metadata [de]serialization
- memory management and optimization.

I'm familiar with <b>cross-platform development</b> for and on all major operating systems, using anything from <b>SDL2</b> to raw <b>OpenGL</b>/<b>GLSL</b> and <b>DirectX</b>/<b>HLSL</b> to <b><a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a></b> and <b><a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a></b>.  Although a majority of my experience lies with <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>, crafting abstractions in most programming languages comes relatively naturally, with a preference toward the statically-typed and functional.

# Experience

## [Punk This Studios](http://punkthisstudios.com)
### 2017.04&ndash;2017.08

Working under the direction of the company founder, and over long-distance remote communication, I rewrote a prototype 2.5D game engine from SDL/C++98 into SDL2/C++11 while cooperatively working out design flaws and designing new features.  We exchanged expertise regarding C++11 standards and practices, maintaining a high level of code quality through code reviews and static analysis tools.

Being a complete rewrite, my work touched every aspect of the engine: resource loading and management, core gameplay code (including design discussions), rendering 2D objects from a 3D point-perspective camera, and remappable controls from multiple input devices.

Additionally, I incorporated and documented build scripts for a [cross-platform build system](http://mesonbuild.com/), enabling a Linux build and bringing it into stricter C++ standards adherence.


## [Kokua Games](https://www.kokuagames.com/)
### 2015.08&ndash;2016.05

This was a 12-member professional game project at the [EAE Master Game Studio](https://eae.utah.edu/graduate-programs/), released on Steam in April 2016.  

Following lead designer Sean Keanaaina's design documentation, I contributed the implementation of the game's central mechanic, an innovative HUD system for modulating the player characters's attributes in realtime, using a combination of basic trigonometry, custom sprite shaders and graphic design techniques.

In addition, I implemented the rest of the HUD, including screen-projected popup effects, game triggers, menu and map screens, shared my expertise with the team on version control, game AI, physics, linear algebra, and sprite systems, and collaborated with the producers in design and research to ensure an educational and culturally authentic experience.


## [The GApp Lab (**The**raputic **G**ames and **App**s **Lab**)](https://thegapp.eae.utah.edu/)
### 2015&ndash;2016

Partnering with research institutions and grants, I was the lead engineer in two projects, using the tools (primarily Unity3D) and methodology of game development to provide a creative perspective on real-world, large-scale health problems.  With Unity, we prototyped software for use on the field in Mumbai to help administer screening tests for contagious illnesses, as well as an interactive informational app for educating potential patients about the purpose, safety, and methodology of prenatal screening tests.

# Summary of Skills

I'm a game engineer with 3+ years of experience in game development contract
work, 5+ years overall development experience, and training in a broad range
of areas. I'm accustomed to acquiring skills and fulfilling roles as the job
mandates, including overseeing <b>source code integration</b>, <b>web/server
administration</b>, <b>team management</b>, and <b>software training</b>.  I
also have volunteer and work experience with <b>individual tutoring</b> in a
variety of mathematics and science subjects.

In summary of my technical skills, I've done work in the following areas:

- 2D and 3D realtime rendering,
- 2D and 3D realtime physics,
- AI and pathfinding,
- networking and messaging,
- event and trigger systems,
- gameplay scripting,
- asset/metadata [de]serialization,
- memory management and optimization.

I'm familiar with <b>cross-platform development</b> for and on all major
operating systems, using anything from <b>SDL2</b> to raw
<b>OpenGL</b>/<b>GLSL</b> and <b>DirectX</b>/<b>HLSL</b> to
[<b>Unity</b>](https://unity3d.com/) and [<b>Phaser</b>](https://phaser.io/).
Although a majority of my experience lies with <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, and
<b>Javascript</b>, crafting abstractions in most programming languages comes
relatively naturally, with a preference toward the functional.


# Experience

## 2017.04--2017.09 [Punk This Studios](http://punkthisstudios.com)

Working under the direction of the company founder, and over long-distance
remote communication, I rewrote a prototype 2.5D game engine from SDL/C++98
into SDL2/C++11 while cooperatively working out design flaws and designing
new features.  We exchanged expertise regarding C++11 standards and
practices, maintaining a high level of code quality through code reviews and
static analysis tools.

Being a complete rewrite, my work touched every aspect of the engine:

- resource loading and management,
- procedural map generation,
- optimized pathfinding,
- rendering 2D objects in multiple layers from a 3D point-perspective camera,
- and remappable controls from multiple input devices.

Additionally, I incorporated and documented build scripts for a
[cross-platform build system](http://mesonbuild.com/), enabling a Linux
build and bringing it into stricter C++ standards adherence.


## 2015.08--2016.05 [Kokua Games](https://www.kokuagames.com/)

This was a 12-member professional game project at the
[EAE Master Game Studio](https://eae.utah.edu/graduate-programs/),
released on Steam in April 2016.  

Following lead designer Sean Keanaaina's design documentation, I contributed
the implementation of the game's central mechanic, ***Maomeka Pule***, an
innovative HUD system for modulating the player characters's attributes in
realtime.  Named for the concept of Prayer (*Pule*), the system was designed
to reflect the geographic houses of [the four primary gods of the Hawaiian
pantheon](http://paulwaters.com/learning/in-the-begining-hawaiian-gods/), and
made use of basic trigonometry, custom shaders and graphic design principles.

Aside from the central *Pule* system, I implemented the rest of the HUD using
Unity 4.6's UI framework, and integrated it with the in-game glossary, called
the ***Halau*** (School). In addition, I:

- trained the team on the proper use of distributed version control,
- stepped in frequently to help resolve merge conflicts and other Git errors,
- shared my expertise in UX/UI design, game AI, physics, and linear algebra,
- assisted in design and research efforts to ensure an educational and
  culturally accurate experience (see:

## 2015.08--2016.05 [<abbr title="Theraputic Games and Apps Lab">The Gapp Lab</abbr>](https://thegapp.eae.utah.edu/)

Partnering with research institutions and grant groups, I was the lead
engineer in two projects, using the tools (primarily Unity) and methodology
of game development to provide a creative perspective on real-world,
large-scale health problems.  Together, we prototyped software for use on the
field in Mumbai to help administer screening tests for contagious illnesses,
as well as an interactive informational app for educating potential patients
about the purpose, safety, and methodology of prenatal screening tests.

Some of the challenges faced in these two projects included:

- providing regular mockups and builds to partners and incorporating feedback,
- interfacing with [RedCAP](https://www.project-redcap.org/) databases in a
  HIPAA-compliant manner,
- importing and parsing data from portable blood screening devices,
- ensuring language-independent UI and pictographic design,
- representing statistical data in interactive, exporable ways,
- and procedurally animating many small actors using Game AI techniques.


## 2014.12--2015.06 [XacFAQ](http://www.guv1.com/xacfaq/)

Founded by industry veteran Jon Dean, XacFAQ used Unity to produce social
games and apps.  I was hired in 2014 on a contract with a third party to
develop a mobile app tie-in to a popular Facebook-centered franchise.

We practiced iterative UX design, working directly with the partner company
and lead designer to prototype, review, and finalize the user interface.  My
work involved:

- in-depth familiarity with the NGUI framework for Unity 4.0,
- manual optimization of art assets for the Unity pipeline,
- client-side JSON-based server interactions,
- and integration with plugins for Facebook accounts and in-app purchases.


## 2012.01--2014.04 [J. Willard Marriott Library](https://lib.utah.edu)

Working in the library's Apple IT Services group, which oversees hundreds of
Mac workstations and servers across the University of Utah campus, I was
assigned special software projects such as:

- automated computer kiosk proxy whitelist management,
- automated software and driver packaging for users of campus printers,
- and ZEROCONF/Bonjour-compatible campus-wide printer service discovery.

As a computer support technician, I also shared responsibly for software
package updates and maintenance, and responding to technical support tickets.

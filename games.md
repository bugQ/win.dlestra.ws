# Experiments
These web-based prototypes were each made in a single day.  
Mouse controls only!

[3&frac14;%](./3.25percent/)
: exploration of modern pointilism
  and the feeling of "stepping back" to expand consciousness

[High Roller](./highroller/)
: subversion of the "roll and move" turn-based board game concept;
  each roll determines the impulse strength of the next.

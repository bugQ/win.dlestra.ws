This game should be hosted on an HTTP server.

If a server is not readily available, a simple solution is to:
1. Download the Mongoose web server at https://www.cesanta.com/products
   making sure to download the binary, not the library.
2. Place the binary in the game folder and run it.
3. If a web browser does not open automatically, you may navigate to
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to view and play the game.
The Mongoose server may be stopped from the system tray after use.

The game is controlled entirely with the mouse pointer.

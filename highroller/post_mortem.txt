Round 3: “Roll and Move”

Author: Harrison “bug” Reiser
Title: High Roller

Hypothesis: how literally can we interpret the implied mechanics of the phrase
 “roll and move” while still subverting the concept?


Test: High Roller is a 3D game which involves rolling a six-sided die across a
 high platform to a small target at the top of the screen.  The game was built
 using Superpowers, a web-based environment for building web-based (WebGL)
 games.  It includes a tool for creating cubic models (which can be composed
 of any number of cubes, but in this case only required one each) and coloring
 their textures directly in the game editor.  This, the scene editor, and a bit
 of scripting and trigonometry were all that were necessary to draft a
 prototype.  After coming up with the concept, the prototype was completed in
 less than five hours.


Results:  The platform is flat, as are the faces of the die, and the hardbody
 physics engine is fairly deterministic.  The only adversaries the player faces
 are the edges of the platform, the peculiarities of how a cube rolls on a flat
 surface, and one other thing: the fact that each roll, each impulse exerted on
 the die in the direction of the player’s click, is scaled by the number it last
 landed on.  In this way, the concept of rolling and moving are retained in the
 most literal of senses, including the staple of such games, the six-sided die.
 However, the mechanic is very unlike other “roll and move” games, not in the
 least because it affords vastly more player agency, while still feeling largely
 unpredictable.
 
 Playtesters enjoyed the concept instantly and wanted for more levels immediately
 after playing.  The hypothesis was fulfilled, and this game seems like a very
 good candidate for further polish.
